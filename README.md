e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

f. What does git diff do?
git diff compares the changes between two different files or commits or branches

g. What is the main branch?
Main branch is the default branch in which verified/valid state of code, free from bugs or error is maintained. Other branches can diverged out and merged back to the main branch upon review and approval. Rules can be set in the repository settings in order to restrict direct pushing of changes into the main branch.

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
It is always better to create our own branch out of the main branch where we can make the intended changes. We should be pushing in to this branch instead of main directly. This can help in having the code reviwed and make sure only verified code gets merged to Main branch to keep it in a valid state.
